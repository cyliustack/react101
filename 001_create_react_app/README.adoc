= Quick Start 
:reproducible:
1. Use npx to create a simple react app project from a template with package manager of npm instead of yarn (i.e., yarn is default)
 `npx create-react-app hello-react --use-npm`
2. Go to the app project and then run a default development server to demo react app.
`cd hello-react && npm start`

The total size of default hello-react is about 300MB (i.e., check by `du -sh hello-react`)
